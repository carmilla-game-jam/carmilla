[center]Carmilla[/center]: I am Mircalla Karnstein. Last surviving member of the Karnstein household and cursed by a yearning to consume blood for the past ███ years.
[center]Carmilla[/center]: I have awoken from the most wondrous dream, in which an alluring maiden stitched a hauntingly beautiful design onto her handkerchief.
[center]Carmilla[/center]: I knew this woman is for me.  I want her- no I will have her. My next prize.
[center]Carmilla[/center]: My thralls went to work, returning with information on three women who would be gracing tonight's masquerade. I must do all in my power to sway her to my side.
