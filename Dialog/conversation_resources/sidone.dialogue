~ introduction

[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Greetings fair stranger.
[center]Carmilla[/center]: Lovely to meet you. In the spirit of a masquerade, I shall introduce myself as Mademoiselle Cat.
[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Then I shall introduce myself as Mademoiselle Doe.
[center]Carmilla[/center]: Quite a pair we’d make, a cat and a deer.
[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Only to be found at a party such as this!

~ fashion
[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Pleased to see you again, Mademoiselle Cat!
- I admire your dress. Which shop did you patronize?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Unfortunately, that is not a thing I can say.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: Oh, a lady must have some secrets to keep.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Of course, something like that...
	=> bad_choice
- I couldn't help but notice the needlework on your handkerchief.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: You have quite the sharp eye, this specific floral pattern is quite dear to me.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: Would you care to show me other pieces?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Of course, not many here would express such interest!
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: What say we take a private tour of the gardens when you're free?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: I would be delighted to accompany you.
	set state["convo"]["sidone"]["fashion_done"] = true
- Your mask seems to hold a story, would you indulge me?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: It’s nothing much, but I do enjoy old roman myths of the roman goddess Diana. 
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: Oh! I hear there’s a most marvelous statuette of the goddess in the garden.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Is there? I haven't made my way to the gardens yet.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: What say we take a private tour of the gardens when you're free?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: I would be delighted to accompany you.

~ family
[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Pleased to see you again, Mademoiselle Cat!
- Here's a philosophical quandry; is there more to life than a family name?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: I would have to agree. One's character is far more important.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: Indeed, a person's character is how I decide to stray away or lean closer...
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Oh, how do you judge my character then?
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: (I must'nt let them sense my ever increasing pangs of hunger.)
	set state["convo"]["sidone"]["family_done"] = true
- I've heard that no family here is untouched by adversity.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Yes, but I've persevered through it all. Do not bring up the past.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: O-oh I thought... *ahem* Please ignore what I've said, my love.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: You may have come by the wrong impression of me.
	=> bad_choice
- I am finding that everyone's curiosity is a bit overwhelming.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Oh, I suppose. I haven't paid attention much.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: I've been quite nosy myself. I suppose it's natural for a masquerade.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: That's true. Frankly, I've been finding it quite titillating.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: (I must admit that she piques my interest.)

~ gossip
[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Pleased to see you again, Mademoiselle Cat!
- I hear you're the talk of the town.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: I didn't think you were the type to listen to idle gossip.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: Listening in can teach you a lot about people, my dear.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: You're likely to glean more lies than truths.
	=> bad_choice
- Has your dance card been filling up?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Gradually, yes. It's all rather new to me.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: I'm happy to teach you more about it, but I'd rather get to know you better, Mademoiselle Doe.
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Hehe. How very coquettish of you, Mademoiselle Cat.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: (Seems I'm on the right track to my dinner.)
	set state["convo"]["sidone"]["gossip_done"] = true
- Are you also new to these events?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: I am, but I'm quite enjoying how it's been going so far.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: Have you met anyone that has caught your fancy yet?
	[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: There’s been a nice lad here or there, but nothing too serious.
	[center]Carmilla[/center]: (Hah, a lad! I'll be happy to show you a time a lad could never...)

~ invite
[center]Carmilla[/center]: Our conversations have been the moon and the stars on a clear night. I'm eager to delve into a deeper understanding of who you are.
[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: It was lovely to speak my mind tonight without remorse, and I would be remiss of we didn't continue.
[center]Carmilla[/center]: Do you care to be whisked away?
[center]Mlle Deer[/center]: Then we must walk to a secret location, hand in hand.
