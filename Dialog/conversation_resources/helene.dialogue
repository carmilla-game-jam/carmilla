~ introduction

[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Very happy to make your acquaintance.
[center]Mircalla[/center]: Of course Mademoiselle, for this evening, you may refer to me as Mademoiselle Cat.
[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Oh! Your mask reminds me quite fondly of my family's dearest kitten, Mieze.
[center]Mircalla[/center]: Is that so? I’d love to call upon your house to see the charming Mieze with my own eyes.
[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Of course, I'll ensure a calling card is passed to your sponsor before the night is over.

[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: I hope this night finds you well.
- I admire your dress. Which shop did you patronize?
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: This? A gift from my brother, though I wouldn't be able to ask from where.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: He must have an exceptionally good eye for fabrics.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Yes... yes he did.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: No use reminiscing! Let's talk about the now.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: That would be splendid!
	set state["convo"]["helene"]["fashion_done"] = true
- I couldn't help but notice the needlework on your handkerchief.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Ah... I’ve unfortunately not had the time to practice.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: Of course, I hear you’ve been quite busy this season.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Yes, but I’m sure my governess will find it best to fit practice into my schedule.

- Your mask seems to hold a story, would you indulge me?
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: This? Simply a fondness for rabbits.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: Another family pet? Or something for the dinner table?
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: I can clearly remember the most scucculent rabbit ragu last thursday.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: No use reminiscing! Let's talk about the now.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: That would be splendid!

~ family
[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: I hope this night finds you well.
- Here's a philosophical quandry; is there more to life than a family name?
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: That's a rather boring subject, in my opinion.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: But I find myself curious all the same.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: You will then have to stay curious about that topic.
	=> bad_choice
- I've heard that no family here is untouched by adversity.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Adversity can be overcome easily, with training and diligence.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: You seem to have your adversaries well sorted.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: It's a work in progress. I hope to learn more information this very fortnight.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: (I must'nt let them sense my ever increasing pangs of hunger.)
	set state["convo"]["helene"]["family_done"] = true
- I am finding that everyone's curiosity is a bit overwhelming.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: I had thought the purpose of a masquerade is to maintain the mystery and not to nose about.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: And have you figured anyone out?
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: A few, not because I'm prying, but General Wilhems has quite an obvious gait!
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: (She is surprisingly observant...)

[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: I hope this night finds you well.
- I hear you're the talk of the town.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: It's nice to be the center of attention, even for a while!
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: You seem to know your way around the crowd tonight.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Naturally, the studies are paying off. Now if only I remembered all the dance etiquette...
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: (I will ensure you dance right into my arms tonight.)
	set state["convo"]["helene"]["gossip_done"] = true
- Has your dance card been filling up?
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Maybe a little too fast, I can barely remember everyone I must dance with.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: It looks like someone is looking for you now...
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Farewell for now, duty calls.
	=> bad_choice
- Are you also new to these events?
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Yes, I couldn't sleep a wink last night in excitement!
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: A kindred spirit, I too had a light slumber.
	[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: How delightful! We must walk around together when I am free.
	[center]Mircalla[/center]: (Seems I'm on the right track to my dinner.)

~ invite
[center]Mircalla[/center]: Our conversations have been the moon and the stars on a clear night. I'm eager to delve into a deeper understanding of who you are.
[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: Naturally, it's quite rare for me to meet someone else so eloquent.
[center]Mircalla[/center]: Do you care to be whisked away?
[center]Mlle Rabbit[/center]: You lead the way then. Where shall we depart to?
